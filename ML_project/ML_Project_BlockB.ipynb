    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The project below aims at showcasing how an OpenAI conversational agent (chatbot) can be trained on self-gathered data and use it as a question and a prompt for the to formulate a response. The technology shows how TAMBR could use the massive amount of information that the ChatGPT-model posseses and also counter it's weakness: being limited. The model doesn't have specific knowledge, like something about the goals of TAMBR as a company. This could be resolved by 'feeding' the bot with own data, for example from an interview with the co-founder of the company. Both the questions and the anwsers could be used to expand the knowledge of the chatbot. This could contribute to the chatbot being available to absorb any type of knowledge. \n",

       "\" Do you create videos or podcasts as part of your business marketing? Are you advertising on YouTube, streaming platforms or television? Then you're probably already creating an audio brand. In this video, I'm going to describe what Sonic Branding is and why it's important for your business. Welcome to Weekly Brand Tips. Brought to you by Elements Brand Management. Weekly videos designed to help you unlock your brand's potential so you can stand out from the competition and create impacts. Please remember to subscribe, use the button below this video and if you hit the bell notification, you'll be notified every time a new video drops. Building an audio element to your brand is often an afterthought for most businesses and in some cases it's something that people don't even think of at all. But if you use music or sound effects or any kind of audio, that could be your voice or the timber of your voice or the way that you use sounds to help elevate videos or anything that you do, then you're already starting to build out an audio element to your brand, whether you realize it or not. Now most people are familiar with building a visual brand so that's kind of your logo, your visual identity and the design elements that go with it. But not a lot of people understand what building an audio brand is or what Sonic Branding is and how you can use that to build up a sort of soundscape for your brand. So what is Sonic Branding? Well if a visual brand is all about how your brand is seen, then Sonic Branding is about how your brand is heard. Now Sonic Branding has been around for a long time but recently due to the fact that more and more people can now produce videos and produce podcasts, Sonic Branding's really come into its own because more people are having to think about the audio side of their brand than ever before. There's lots of different ways that you can build this out and different things that you can use to develop your Sonic Branding. And in this video I'm sort of going to go over a few things, you know, what Sonic Branding is but also give you a few ideas on how you can build it out as part of your brand. So everything you do from the music that you use to the sound effects that you use, to the voice overs that you have, the people you choose to do voice overs, and the way that you use your voice in videos or podcasts, all comes together to form your Sonic Branding. Think of things like the sound when you start your PlayStation up or the Intel Inside advert from the 90s or those really annoying but surprisingly memorable go-compare adverts. All of these use audio elements or Sonic Branding or audio hooks to kind of make them more memorable and build out that brand and that experience. If you look at any Coca-Cola advert, you're bound to hear things like the Ringpool and how they've accentuated the opening of the Ringpool or the way that the ice hits the sides of the glass and the fizz the bubbles popping. All of this has been done deliberately in order to build out a soundscape that helps to describe the Coca-Cola brand. So why does this matter? Well, as with all brand building, you are trying to build something in the mind of your audience that is memorable, distinctive and iconic and then elicits a gut feeling or association that connects your audience to your brand. Now there is no better way of doing this than using sound. Now using sound, if you've ever gone to watch a film or any sort of TV program and you've turned, managed to turn the music off. I don't know if you've ever seen anything like that but if you turn the music off of a film, it really does seem bland. It seems like there's nothing going on and you don't know what to feel. The music almost in films tells you what to feel and how you should be feeling and brands that are clever and use site branding the right way. What they do is they help to take the viewer or their listener on a journey and allow them to understand what they should be feeling and this adds a layer to your brand where you can add that extra extra something that really talks to your audience. So if your brand is based on a personality type of say the Jester, the Jester archetype or the hero, you can really use that in the music that you use. So you can already imagine if I said to you the Jester archetype, the kind of fun loving, kind of playful type character, you can imagine some sort of soundscapes and sound effects that might go with that brand. If you say the hero type archetype, you can imagine the sort of music, the trunk and kind of sounds that could be used to get that across with your sonic branding. So how does sonic branding fit into your wider brand identity? Well, as with all sort of elements to your brand identity, it wants to be consistent. It wants to make sense with the rest elements, the rest of the other elements of your brand and it wants to do it in a way that complements your brand as opposed to dominates it. So you can imagine from the previous point, like we said, if you're a hero brand archetype, the soundscape or the sonic branding wants to make sense with your internal brand. So if you're the hero archetype, a slow meandering harp is not going to be the right sound for a hero sort of brand, whereas for a caregiver type brand, it might be. So it wants to make sure that the the sonic branding is still appropriate with the particular brand, it makes sense with the internal brand and it also adds a sort of an audio backdrop to allow the visual brand to play in. Comment below with the feeling you want to create with your brand's sonic branding. So examples of sonic branding, we mentioned earlier on the intel inside advert from the 90s with that jingle that just everyone can still remember. Coca-Cola adverts with the little sound effects of the ring pool and the ice in the glass. Another one that's quite recent is the intro to Game of Thrones. So that particular intro, the music that was used for that was done so well that it really set up the stage for that series and that fantasy world. But the things actually that happened before that, so the two adverts before the Game of Thrones came on. So in the UK, we had Volvo ad and then we had the HBO Stinger. Both of those really showed great examples of sonic branding. So the HBO sound that came on with the logo, the HBO logo, that kind of, I can't explain the sound, but that kind of operatic sound almost. That become iconic in itself and kind of primed you ready for the Game of Thrones series to come on. Now that piece of sonic branding there was really well done. And before the HBO Stinger in the UK, we had Volvo advert. It's going to Volvo short, I don't know, 10 second piece that would come on before the HBO and then Game of Thrones. And that Volvo advert was like a breath of silence followed by Volvo spoken in a Swedish accent in a very calm, deliberate way, which if you think about the brand Volvo an idea of safety and the idea of something being sturdy instead fast and very organic and very natural and very down to earth and family orientated, the way that that audio Stinger came across in that particular advert was so sort of in keeping with the brand. It was really well done. And if you look at the logo of Volvo as well, the way that they've spaced out the letters and the visual identity is almost like when the person who was saying the word Volvo was saying it, they were reading the spaces in between the actual brand logo and that visual identity. So it was done in a really good way and it really helped to get across the characteristics of the brand in not just the visual identity, but the audio brand and how they put that across. So where can you start with your audio branding or your sonic branding? If you look at some of the TV ads and look at some of the ads on the streaming platforms, take note of what they're doing and what people are actually using and how they're using audio to build their brand. Think about what emotion or feeling you're trying to create with your brand. Is this mysterious and elusive? Is it heroic and triumphant? Is it fun? Is it caring? And then think about the sounds and the instruments that you could use to convey those particular feelings and emotions. Are they natural sounding? Is it electronic? Is it very organic and tribal and drum based? Is it upbeat? Is it fast paced? The tempo change? All these things can be used to add color and variation to the particular brand, your brand and the feelings and emotions you're trying to create. Maybe your brand would benefit from using a lot of silence or really faint sounds or potentially spoken word or even an operatic choir. Anything is possible for you to use to get the sonic branding side of your brand done and get it handled and effectively communicated so that it resonates with your audience but is still in keeping with your existing brand. You do want to make sure that this fits in with your existing brand and it's something that you can be consistent with. There's no good in setting up your sonic branding at the beginning but then it's something that you can't follow up on or you can't be consistent with. So make sure whatever you do, whatever you use for your sonic branding, you have an idea and of what you're trying to create so that you can replicate that down the line and you can keep adding to it as you need to whenever you do a new video series or you do a new ad. You can tweak it slightly but it's still in keeping the previous sonic branding and your actual overall brand as a whole. So now you have a clearer idea on what sonic branding is. If you're looking to have any help with this or you need any help with it, there is a link in the description to schedule the call with us elements brand management and we can have a quick discovery call and see what we might be able to do to help you with your sonic branding.

       "[\" Introduction streaming platforms or television? Then you're probably already creating an audio brand. In this video, I'm going to describe what Sonic Branding is and why it's important for your business. Welcome to Weekly Brand Tips. Brought to you by Elements Brand Management.

Building an audio element to your brand is often an afterthought for most businesses and in some cases it's something that people don't even think of at all. But if you use music or sound effects or any kind of audio, that could be your voice or the timber of your voice or the way that you use sounds to help elevate videos or anything that you do, then you're already starting to build out an audio element to your brand, whether you realize it or not. Now most people are familiar with building a visual brand so that's kind of your logo, your visual identity and the design elements that go with it. But not a lot of people understand what building an audio brand is or what Sonic Branding is and how you can use that to build up a sort of soundscape for your brand.\",\n",
       " \" What is Sonic Branding? So what is Sonic Branding? Well if a visual brand is all about how your brand is seen, then Sonic Branding is about how your brand is heard. Now Sonic Branding has been around for a long time but recently due to the fact that more and more people can now produce videos and produce podcasts, Sonic Branding's really come into its own because more people are having to think about the audio side of their brand than ever before. There's lots of different ways that you can build this out and different things that you can use to develop your Sonic Branding. And in this video I'm sort of going to go over a few things, you know, what Sonic Branding is but also give you a few ideas on how you can build it out as part of your brand. So everything you do from the music that you use to the sound effects that you use, to the voice overs that you have, the people you choose to do voice overs, and the way that you use your voice in videos or podcasts, all comes together to form your Sonic Branding. Think of things like the sound when you start your PlayStation up or the Intel Inside advert from the 90s or those really annoying but surprisingly memorable go-compare adverts. All of these use audio elements or Sonic Branding or audio hooks to kind of make them more memorable and build out that brand and that experience. If you look at any Coca-Cola advert, you're bound to hear things like the Ringpool and how they've accentuated the opening of the Ringpool or the way that the ice hits the sides of the glass and the fizz the bubbles popping. All of this has been done deliberately in order to build out a soundscape that helps to describe the Coca-Cola brand. So why does this matter? Well, as with all brand building, you are trying to build something in the mind of your audience that is memorable, distinctive and iconic and then elicits a gut feeling or association that connects your audience to your brand. Now there is no better way of doing this than using sound. Now using sound, if you've ever gone to watch a film or any sort of TV program and you've turned, managed to turn the music off. I don't know if you've ever seen anything like that but if you turn the music off of a film, it really does seem bland. It seems like there's nothing going on and you don't know what to feel. The music almost in films tells you what to feel and how you should be feeling and brands that are clever and use site branding the right way. What they do is they help to take the viewer or their listener on a journey and allow them to understand what they should be feeling and this adds a layer to your brand where you can add that extra extra something that really talks to your audience. So if your brand is based on a personality type of say the Jester, the Jester archetype or the hero, you can really use that in the music that you use. So you can already imagine if I said to you the Jester archetype, the kind of fun loving, kind of playful type character, you can imagine some sort of soundscapes and sound effects that might go with that brand. If you say the hero type archetype, you can imagine the sort of music, the trunk and kind\"]"

Building an audio element to your brand is often an afterthought for most businesses and in some cases it's something that people don't even think of at all. But if you use music or sound effects or any kind of audio, that could be your voice or the timber of your voice or the way that you use sounds to help elevate videos or anything that you do, then you're already starting to build out an audio element to your brand, whether you realize it or not. Now most people are familiar with building a visual brand so that's kind of your logo, your visual identity and the design elements that go with it. But not a lot of people understand what building an audio brand is or what Sonic Branding is and how you can use that to build up a sort of soundscape for your brand.\\n What is Sonic Branding? So what is Sonic Branding? Well if a visual brand is all about how your brand is seen, then Sonic Branding is about how your brand is heard. Now Sonic Branding has been around for a long time but recently due to the fact that more and more people can now produce videos and produce podcasts, Sonic Branding's really come into its own because more people are having to think about the audio side of their brand than ever before. There's lots of different ways that you can build this out and different things that you can use to develop your Sonic Branding. And in this video I'm sort of going to go over a few things, you know, what Sonic Branding is but also give you a few ideas on how you can build it out as part of your brand. So everything you do from the music that you use to the sound effects that you use, to the voice overs that you have, the people you choose to do voice overs, and the way that you use your voice in videos or podcasts, all comes together to form your Sonic Branding. Think of things like the sound when you start your PlayStation up or the Intel Inside advert from the 90s or those really annoying but surprisingly memorable go-compare adverts. All of these use audio elements or Sonic Branding or audio hooks to kind of make them more memorable and build out that brand and that experience. If you look at any Coca-Cola advert, you're bound to hear things like the Ringpool and how they've accentuated the opening of the Ringpool or the way that the ice hits the sides of the glass and the fizz the bubbles popping. All of this has been done deliberately in order to build out a soundscape that helps to describe the Coca-Cola brand. So why does this matter? Well, as with all brand building, you are trying to build something in the mind of your audience that is memorable, distinctive and iconic and then elicits a gut feeling or association that connects your audience to your brand. Now there is no better way of doing this than using sound. Now using sound, if you've ever gone to watch a film or any sort of TV program and you've turned, managed to turn the music off. I don't know if you've ever seen anything like that but if you turn the music off of a film, it really does seem bland. It seems like there's nothing going on and you don't know what to feel. The music almost in films tells you what to feel and how you should be feeling and brands that are clever and use site branding the right way. What they do is they help to take the viewer or their listener on a journey and allow them to understand what they should be feeling and this adds a layer to your brand where you can add that extra extra something that really talks to your audience. So if your brand is based on a personality type of say the Jester, the Jester archetype or the hero, you can really use that in the music that you use. So you can already imagine if I said to you the Jester archetype, the kind of fun loving, kind of playful type character, you can imagine some sort of soundscapes and sound effects that might go with that brand. If you say the hero type archetype, you can imagine the sort of music, the trunk and kind\""
